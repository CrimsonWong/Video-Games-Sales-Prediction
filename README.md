# Video-Games-Sales-Prediction

This is the final project of INFO6105 Data Science Engineering Methods. My co-workers are Hao Zhang and Zechuan Miao. 

In this project We analysted the original dataset, which came from Kaggle, plotting all interesting information on different type of graph by using seaborn and matplotlib.pyplot. Besides, we made predictions of global game sales using XGBoost and Random Forest and using MAE(Mean Absolut Error) to calculate the accurancy of our result.
